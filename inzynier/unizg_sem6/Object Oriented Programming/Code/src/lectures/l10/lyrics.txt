Ay, I'm a big boy now
I'm ready to leave, ciao, mamma, ciao
Ay, I'm a big boy now
I'm going away and I sold my cow
Before I leave, I must confess
I need a round of decompress
One more time for all the good times
Rim-tim-tagi-digi, dim-tim-tim
Gonna miss you all, but mostly the cat
Gonna miss my hay, gonna miss my bed
But most of all, I'ma miss the dance
So come on y'all, let us prance
Now don't call, don't write
I'm leavin' with the first light
Don't cry, but dance
Rim-tim-tagi-digi, dim-tim-tim
There's no going back (whoa)
My presence fades to black (whoa)
Yeah, there's no going back (whoa)
My anxiety attacks (whoa)
Rim-tim-tagi-digi, dim-tim-tagi-digi-dim
I hope I find peace in the noise
Wanna become one of them city boys
They're all so pretty and so advanced
Maybe they also know our dance
Bye mom, bye dad
Meow, cat, please, meow back
Don't cry, just dance
Rim-tim-tagi-digi, dim-tim-tim
There's no going back (whoa)
My presence fades to black (whoa)
Yeah, there's no going back (whoa)
My anxiety attacks (whoa)
Rim-tim-tagi-digi-dim-tim-tagi-digi-dim
There's no going back (whoa)
My presence fades to black (whoa)
There's no going back (whoa)
Anxiety attacks (whoa)
Rim-tim-tagi-digi, dim-tim-tagi-digi-dim
There's no going back (whoa)
My presence fades to black (whoa)
Yeah, there's no going back (whoa)
My anxiety attacks (whoa)
Rim-tim-tagi-digi, dim-tim-tagi-digi-dim
